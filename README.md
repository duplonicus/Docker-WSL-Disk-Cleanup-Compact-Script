# Docker WSL Disk Cleanup & Compact Script

A PowerShell script for automated Docker maintenance on Windows with WSL2 backend. This script performs monthly Docker cleanup and virtual disk compaction to prevent disk space bloat and maintain optimal Docker performance.

## Overview

Docker Desktop with WSL2 backend can accumulate significant disk space over time due to:
- Unused containers, images, and build cache
- WSL2 virtual disk files that grow but never shrink automatically
- Dangling volumes and networks

This script automates the cleanup process and can reclaim **substantial disk space** (users typically see 20-140GB+ freed during initial runs).

## Features

- ‚úÖ **Automated Docker cleanup** - Removes unused containers, images, networks, and build cache
- ‚úÖ **WSL2 virtual disk compaction** - Shrinks Docker's virtual disk file to actual usage size  
- ‚úÖ **Graceful Docker daemon shutdown** - Prevents "WSL distro terminated abruptly" errors
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive logging** - Detailed logs for monitoring and troubleshooting
- ‚úÖ **Safe restart sequence** - Ensures Docker Desktop restarts cleanly after maintenance
- ‚úÖ **Multiple fallback methods** - Handles different Docker Desktop versions and configurations
- ‚úÖ **Production ready** - Designed for unattended monthly automation

## Prerequisites

- **Windows 10/11** with WSL2 enabled
- **Docker Desktop** with WSL2 backend
- **PowerShell 5.1** or later  
- **Administrator privileges** (required for diskpart operations)

## Installation

1. **Download the script** to your preferred location (e.g., C:\Scripts\)
2. **Create the log directory**: New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "C:\Logs" -Force
3. **Test the script** by running it manually first

## Usage

### Manual Execution
# Run as Administrator
.\docker_wsl_compact_vdisk.ps1

### Custom Log Location
.\docker_wsl_compact_vdisk.ps1 -LogPath "D:\MyLogs\DockerCleanup.log"

## Automated Scheduling

### Option 1: Windows Task Scheduler (Recommended)
1. Open **Task Scheduler** as Administrator
2. **Create Basic Task** ‚Üí Name: "Docker Monthly Cleanup"
3. **Trigger**: Monthly (first Sunday at 3:00 AM recommended)
4. **Action**: Start a program
   - **Program**: powershell.exe
   - **Arguments**: -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Scripts\docker_wsl_compact_vdisk.ps1"
5. **Settings**: Check "Run with highest privileges"

### Option 2: PowerShell Scheduled Job
# Run once as Administrator to create the scheduled job
$trigger = New-JobTrigger -Weekly -WeeksInterval 4 -DaysOfWeek Sunday -At 3AM
Register-ScheduledJob -Name "DockerMonthlyCleanup" -ScriptBlock {
    & "C:\Scripts\docker_wsl_compact_vdisk.ps1"
} -Trigger $trigger

## What the Script Does

### 1. **Docker Cleanup Phase**
- Removes all unused containers
- Removes all unused images (including dangling images)
- Removes all unused networks
- Clears Docker build cache
- Reports space reclaimed

### 2. **Graceful Shutdown Phase**
- Stops Docker daemon using docker desktop stop
- Terminates Docker WSL distros if needed
- Safely shuts down WSL subsystem

### 3. **Disk Compaction Phase**
- Locates Docker's WSL virtual disk (docker_data.vhdx)
- Uses Windows diskpart to compact the virtual disk
- Reports actual disk space reclaimed

### 4. **Restart Phase**  
- Restarts Docker Desktop
- Waits for Docker daemon to be ready
- Verifies successful startup

## Expected Results

### Initial Run
- **Docker cleanup**: 5-50GB typically freed
- **Disk compaction**: 20-140GB+ reclaimed from bloated virtual disk
- **Total time**: 2-5 minutes

### Monthly Runs
- **Docker cleanup**: 2-20GB freed (depends on usage)
- **Disk compaction**: 1-10GB reclaimed
- **Total time**: 1-3 minutes

## Log Files

Logs are stored at C:\Logs\DockerCleanup.log by default and include:
- Timestamp for each operation
- Docker disk usage before/after cleanup
- Space reclaimed by each phase
- Any errors or warnings
- Complete diskpart output for troubleshooting

### Sample Log Output
2025-09-16 01:26:39 - === Starting Docker Monthly Cleanup ===
2025-09-16 01:26:44 - Initial usage: Images: 8.069GB, Containers: 64.88MB, Volumes: 25.76GB
2025-09-16 01:26:45 - Gracefully stopping Docker daemon...
2025-09-16 01:27:11 - Docker daemon stopped successfully via CLI
2025-09-16 01:27:17 - Initial VHDX size: 40.22 GB
2025-09-16 01:27:45 - Final VHDX size: 40.22 GB
2025-09-16 01:27:52 - Docker is ready. Version: 27.4.0
2025-09-16 01:27:52 - === Docker Monthly Cleanup Completed Successfully ===

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Won't Start After Script
- **Solution**: Open Docker Desktop ‚Üí Troubleshoot ‚Üí Restart
- **Prevention**: Script includes graceful shutdown to prevent this

### "Access Denied" Errors
- **Cause**: Script not running as Administrator
- **Solution**: Always run PowerShell as Administrator

### Script Can't Find Docker Disk
- **Cause**: Non-standard Docker installation location
- **Solution**: Check script logs for actual disk location and update path

### PowerShell Execution Policy Error
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

## Technical Details

### Docker Disk Locations
The script automatically detects Docker's WSL disk in these locations:
- %LOCALAPPDATA%\Docker\wsl\disk\docker_data.vhdx (primary)
- %LOCALAPPDATA%\Docker\wsl\data\ext4.vhdx (fallback)

### Supported Docker Versions
- Docker Desktop 4.0+ with WSL2 backend
- Works with both Windows Home and Pro editions

### Safety Features
- **Administrator check** - Prevents permission issues
- **Docker readiness verification** - Ensures Docker is operational before cleanup
- **Multiple shutdown methods** - Graceful ‚Üí Forceful fallback
- **Error handling** - Comprehensive try/catch blocks
- **Process verification** - Confirms each step before proceeding
